Implementation is done in Keras (Please make sure you have TensorFlow v1.15 installed). This repo consists of train and test code along with pretrained models for noise-free and noisy datasets. We also introduce a dataset Lowlight Image Dataset, created using images from MIT outdoor and indoor scenes dataset, on both noise-free settings(LID) and noisy settings(LID_NOISE). Noise was added in MATLAB and is of Poisson Gaussian nature to mimic real life settings as much as possible. Complete dataset available in link below.
